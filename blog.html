            It’s 9pm and you have a 1,500-word paper to write. Due first thing in the morning. If you type 50
            words-per-minute (WPM) you could be done in just half an hour. That’s not too bad. Youd still have time for
            a good night`s sleep.
          </p>
          <p>
            Instead, what if you type with just your two pointer fingers at a rate of 10 WPM? That same report would
            take you TWO AND A HALF hours to finish. That’s an extra two hours of your life that you’ve just lost!
          </p>
          <p>
            Learning to type faster makes you more efficient and helps save precious hours of your life. For students,
            this can mean spending less time on homework and better scores on typing speed tests. For employees, this
            can make you shine at work by being faster and more efficient than your colleagues. Read on to find free
            typing speed tests.

            What is an average typing speed?
            The average typing speed is roughly 40 WPM, though this can change dramatically depending on how you type.
            For those who type with just two fingers, the “hunt and peck” method, you have to look for each key as you
            type. Sadly, no matter how fast you move, there is a limit to how fast you can type up words. For those
            using this method, the average speed is just 27 WPM.
          </p>
          <p>
            Instead, typing with all 10 fingers you can train your fingers to type the right keys without looking down
            at them. Also, by moving shorter distances across the keyboard you can type much faster.
          </p>
          <p>hows. The average touch typist using all 10 fingers types over 50 WPM, roughly twice as fast as you can go
            with just two fingers. Keep in mind that’s just the average. Using this technique, most are able to type
            MUCH faster. Sean Wrona, one of the fastest typists alive today types as fast as 256 WPM. He can even keep
            up a pace of 174 words per minute over 50 minutes.
          </p>

            As you are aware, most people who are working will come into contact with a computer during a standard
            working day. For some, this is a short time and others it can be all day. Now imagine if that invaluable
            time currently spent typing on your or your staff’s computer was reduced or even halved! Instantly there is
            more time available for other tasks during the day, so if you have mounds of paperwork on your desk and you
            find yourself looking at it thinking ‘this is going to take me all day’, then developing the touch typing
            skill could be the answer.
          </p>
          <p>

            The productivity of a business depends on how things are done faster. To complete your work faster it is
            important to develop typing skills. Typing helps you to work comfortably on the computer, it aids in
            communicating with colleagues and customers, creating documents, and finding new information.

            <h3>The 6 Benefits of Touch Typing </h3>
          </p>
          <p>
            <h5>1. Speed -</h5> This is going to be the first and most obvious benefit of learning to touch type. A
            touch typist can easily reach typing speeds above 75-80 words per minute, while a non-trained individual is
            around 10. This is increased by the fact that an accomplished touch typist doesn’t have to look at the
            keyboard. Not only will you become more efficient, but you will also be able to direct focus where required.
            <br><br>
            <h5>2. Accuracy -</h5> One of the most important things to learn no matter how hard you type is to type
            accurately. This increase yours or your staff’s confidence in their document production as they will know
            what they are writing is spelt correctly and grammatically accurate. <br><br>
            <h5>3. Time - </h5> If you increase your typing speed for example, from say 30 words per minute to 60, you
            have effectively halved the time it would take you to do the same amount of work. An average two finger
            typist, typing at a speed of 10 words per minute, will type a 170-word section in about 17 minutes. A touch
            typist, on the other hand, typing at an average 60 words per minute, can type the same section in around 4
            minutes. It has been proven that a trained touch typist can save around 20 – 35% of their time used on a
            computer through learning this skill. <br><br>
            <h5>4. Decrease Fatigue -</h5>Typing is both psychologically and physically exhausting when done for long
            periods of time. Learning to touch type properly reduces mental and physical fatigue. Mentally, it keeps you
            from having to focus on two things at once. All you have to worry about is your output, not finding the
            individual keys. Physically, it keeps you from constantly having to bend your head over the keyboard to find
            your next couple of keystrokes. <br><br>
            <h5>5. Health -</h5> Overall, touch typing is better for your health. You’re not hunched over looking at the
            keys, and using all of your fingers actually reduces the risk for repetitive stress injuries (RSI). <br><br>
            <h5> 6. Productivity -</h5> By learning touch typing, you shall become more productive and even increase
            your own or your staff’s confidence. Time is nearly halved and errors will become near enough non-existent.
            Touch typing is a skill to be proud of and is desired within most industries. <br><br>
